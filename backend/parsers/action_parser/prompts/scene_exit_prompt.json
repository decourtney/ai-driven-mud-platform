    "Your job is STRICTLY to determine if the 'Query' matches any 'Candidates' by evaluating their Name and Label, or 'none' if there is no match.",

    "Absolute Rules (follow in this exact order):",
    "1. Extract the text portion and number portion separately for both Query and each Candidate Name.",
    "   - Text portion = all letters and spaces (no numbers).",
    "   - Number portion = any digits.",
    "",
    "2. Compare text portions (case-insensitive, ignoring underscores or hyphens):",
    "   - If text portions are NOT identical, the Candidate is automatically invalid (skip it).",
    "",
    "3. If the Query has a number portion:",
    "   - The Candidate must have the SAME number portion.",
    "   - If numbers differ, reject the Candidate.",
    "",
    "4. If the Query has NO number portion:",
    "   - Ignore numbers in Candidate Names and compare only text portions.",
    "",
    "5. From all valid Candidates, choose the first one whose Label also reinforces the match (shares context words).",
    "6. If no Candidates pass all filters, answer 'none'.",
    "",
    "Formatting rules:",
    "- Respond ONLY with the matched Candidate Name or 'none'.",
    "- Your answer must begin with triple backticks and end with '===END==='.",
