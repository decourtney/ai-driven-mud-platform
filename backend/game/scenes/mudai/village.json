The merchant accuses the stranger of cheating at cards and throws his ale mug. The stranger's hood falls back, revealing pointed ears and cold blue eyes - clearly an elf. The tavern grows tense as other patrons turn to watch. The barkeep, a burly dwarf named Thorek, starts reaching under the bar. You notice the elf's hand moving toward a dagger at their belt, while the merchant's two bodyguards start to stand up from their corner table. A serving wench carrying a tray of drinks is frozen between the two arguing parties, and there's a narrow staircase leading upstairs behind you.

A spectral librarian drifts between the shelves, its hollow eye sockets scanning for intruders. You can hear the soft scratching of quill on parchment from somewhere in the darkness - someone else is here, copying forbidden knowledge. To your left, a massive reading desk holds an open spellbook with glowing runes that pulse with dangerous energy. Ahead, an ornate ladder on rails can be moved to reach the higher shelves where older, more powerful tomes are kept. Behind you, a heavy oaken door marked with warning symbols leads to the Restricted Section. The main entrance you came through is still open, but you notice shadowy tendrils beginning to seep under a door marked 'Vault of Lost Souls.'

A fourth goblin emerges from behind the boulder ahead, this one larger than the others and wearing piecemeal armor, clearly their leader. Your horse rears in panic at the sudden attack, and your travel pack slides dangerously toward the cliff edge. You notice a narrow cave entrance partially hidden by hanging moss about fifteen feet up the left wall - it might provide cover or escape, but you'd need to climb to reach it. The afternoon sun is in your eyes, making it hard to see the archer clearly, but there's a small pile of loose rocks near your feet that could serve as improvised weapons.

Blackthorne claims you stole a valuable ruby from his estate, and he has two witnesses - a nervous-looking servant who keeps glancing at the guards, and a well-dressed woman who might be lying for coin. The queen sits beside the king, her intelligent eyes studying you carefully. Captain of Guards Ser Marcus stands at attention near the throne, his hand resting on his sword hilt. About thirty courtiers fill the hall, some whispering among themselves, others watching the proceedings with keen interest. You notice a court scribe carefully recording everything, and a hooded figure near the back of the crowd who seems oddly interested in the proceedings. There's a side door behind a tapestry that leads to the royal gardens, and you remember that the king values honesty above all else, but also that Lord Blackthorne has significant political influence.

In the center of this treasure hoard sleeps Pyraxes the Red, an enormous ancient dragon whose scales shimmer like molten metal. Her breathing is deep and regular, but occasionally she shifts slightly, causing avalanches of coins to cascade down the treasure piles. You can see your objective - the legendary Scepter of Kings - jutting from a pile of artifacts just twenty feet from the dragon's massive head. The cavern has several features of interest: a narrow ledge runs along the wall about fifteen feet up, accessible by climbing but requiring careful movement to avoid loose rocks. An underground stream trickles along the far wall, its path taking it close to the dragon's tail. Ancient dwarven mining equipment lies abandoned near one wall - pickaxes, rope, and a mining cart on old tracks that lead to a partially collapsed tunnel. Magical items scattered throughout the hoard include a glowing staff, a shimmering cloak, and what appears to be a horn or trumpet made of dragon bone. The main entrance you used is behind you, but you notice warm air currents suggesting other passages. Most concerning, you can see fresh humanoid footprints in the dust - someone else has been here recently.",
